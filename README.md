Top 20 C++ Projects With Source Code
As a part of the evolution of the C family of languages, C++ is designed by renowned computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop. It was designed as a cross-platform improvement of C to equip programmers with a more elevated degree of command over memory and system resources.

Some anoint C++ as “C with classes” owing to the fact that it brings forth the principles of object-oriented programming, like the utilization of defined classes, to the framework of the C programming language. With time, C++ has stayed a very practical language not limited to just computer programming but in introducing new programmers regarding the working of object-oriented programming. Nevertheless, it does not only back object-oriented, but also procedural and functional. Owing to its elevated scalability and flexibility, C++ can be utilized to create a wide range of applications, browsers, software, GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), OSs (operating systems), games and many more. Now, C++ is still very admired for its impressive portability which lets programmers create programs that can operate on various operating systems or platforms very efficiently. Though being a middle-end language C++ is still close to C it can be utilized for low-level manipulation owing to its close relation with machine language.
Let us take a look at the features of C++

1. Machine Independent

A C++ executable is machine-independent and not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t operate on Windows). Let us comprehend this characteristic of C++ with this instance. Let’s say you have documented a piece of code that can operate on OSes like Linux, Windows/Mac, which makes C++ machine-independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot operate on other operating systems.

2. Simple

C++ is a simple language, programs can be broken down into logical units and it has rich library support and a myriad of data types. Also, C++’s auto Keyword makes life simple.

The auto keyword

The idea of the auto was to create the C++ compiler to figure out the data type while compiling rather than making you declare the data type every time. You have to keep in mind that without an initializer you cannot declare something. There has to be some way for the compiler to deduce your type.

3. High-Level Language

Unlike C which is a mid-level programming language, C++, on the other hand, is a high-level language. It makes life simple to work in C++ as it is closely linked with the human-comprehensible English language.

4. Popular

C++ can be the base language for several other programming languages that backs the object-oriented programming feature. Bjarne Stroustrup found the first object-oriented language ever called Simula 67, which lacked simulations, and decided to design C++.

5. Case-sensitive

It is quite evident that C++ is a very case-sensitive programming language. For instance, cin is utilized to take input from the input stream, but the “Cin” won’t work.

6. Compiler Based

C++ is a compiler-based language, which means C++ programs used to be compiled, and their executable file is made to execute it. Owing to this, C++ is a comparatively faster language than Java and Python.

7. Dynamic Memory Allocation

When the program runs in C++ then the variables are assigned the dynamical heap space. Within the functions, the variables are allotted in the stack space. Several times, we might not be aware of how much memory is required to keep particular pieces of information in a defined variable and the size of needed memory can be specified at run time.

8. Memory Management

C++ lets us allot the memory of a variable or an array during the run time. This is regarded as Dynamic Memory Allocation. In other programming languages like Python and Java, the compiler handles the memories allocated to variables automatically. But such is not the case in C++. In C++, the memory has to be de-allocated dynamically allocated memory manually after it is of no use. The allocation and deallocation of the memory can be performed with the help of the new and delete operators respectively.

C++ Projects 
The best way to kick start your career with any language is to create a few practice projects in them. Looking through a book imparts some knowledge worth having, but that will help you learn real skills. The best way to learn more about the features of the C++ function is to work on a few basic projects. One thing that most learners have a problem with is choosing their first C++ project out of all project ideas. These beginner-level projects can assist newbies to understand the basics of the C++ programming language and create a resume worthy of showing recruiters. The intermediate-level projects and expert-level projects will help experienced professionals to advance in their careers. So, mentioned below are some fun and easy C++ projects for beginners, intermediate and experienced folks.
